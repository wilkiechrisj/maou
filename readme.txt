Welcome to my game project - Maou!

Maou is a roguelike autobattler. This means that there isn't really a "save" state for the game
and the game also plays itself! Your job is to guide your hero through the map using
the left and right buttons at the bottom-left of the screen.

There are bosses, minions, camps, and shops

camp = healing
shops = buy spells
bosses/minions = a battle!

The spells you buy from the shop (and even the ones you start with) can be cast by clicking on them
in the middle of the screen while in combat.

When in a shop you can buy spells by clicking the $ icon next to the spell description.

In the bottom-right corner of the screen there is a pause and play button to control the flow of combat. If you pause
every thing stops so you can plan ahead or go do something else.

The two buttons at bottom center are used to access wikipedia information about the enemies you are facing. You
can even specify for a spanish translation! The other one is for opening this very tutorial!

Thank you! Please enjoy!
